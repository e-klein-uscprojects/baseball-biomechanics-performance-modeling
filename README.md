# Biomechanical Modeling & Athletic Development in Baseball

I am a baseball athlete with firsthand experience navigating the physical, strategic, and the demands of high-performance sport. Over the course of my athletic career, I have committed substantial time to training, competing, and refining my ability to perform under pressure. That experience has deeply shaped my approach to performance science, and ultimately led me to construct this repository.

This project centers around the application of biomechanics and predictive modeling to enhance three pillars of athletic output: movement efficiency, reaction speed, and endurance. While my work is rooted in baseball, the methods and analysis documented here reflect a broader commitment to athletic development across disciplines. My aim has never been to chase complexity for complexity’s sake, but rather to design systems that are iterative, adaptive, and grounded in measurable outcomes.

In addition to my experience on the field, I hold a certification from the National Academy of Sports Medicine as a Certified Personal Trainer. I earned this credential not to instruct others but to elevate my own understanding of the body—to develop frameworks that reinforce personal growth and durability. That learning continues to inform my work today.

This repository contains not just code and charts, but a record of intention: sensor analyses from training blocks, modeling scripts built to track motor fatigue, and notebooks that study how athletes respond to shifting tactical demands. Each insight presented here stems from direct experience, strategic curiosity, and the belief that performance cannot be divorced from preparation.

The opportunity to share this work is meaningful to me. It represents both a reflection on my time in baseball and a blueprint for what comes next—a deeper, more sustainable approach to performance. I hope these materials serve coaches, analysts, and athletes who value clarity, purpose, and rigor in athletic development.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
